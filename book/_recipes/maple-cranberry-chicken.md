    1. Season the chicken thighs on both sides with salt and pepper and add them to the hot pan to sear them on both sides until golden brown
    2. Don't worry about cooking them through at this stage, just focus on crisping the skin.
    3. Once the chicken is browned, remove it to a plate and set aside.
3. Add the white wine to the pan with the chicken juices and whisk as the wine begins to evaporate
    1. Add the maple syrup, dijon mustard, and cranberries, and whisk to combine until a thin sauce forms
4. Add the chicken back into the pan and spoon the sauce over the chicken
    1. Sprinkle the cranberries into the pan over the chicken and add the sprigs of rosemary around the chicken
5. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until cooked through
