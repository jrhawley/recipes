## References & Notes

[^1]: Original recipe: Giacomo Grillo
> We can say that this is a classic.
> In Italy you may find a risotto cooked with the same ingredients, but a pasta dish is a perfect way to celebrate two ingredients made for one another.

[^2]: Try to use "elongated shallots" (aka "banana shallots") because they're sweeter and less harsh on the palate.

[^3]: Make sure that frozen prawns are completely defrosted / fresh prawns are clean (I [Giacomo] normally use raw peeled frozen prawns)
