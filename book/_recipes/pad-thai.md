## References & Notes

[^1]: Original recipe:  Heather McNeil

[^2]: Taste the noodles to ensure they're like al dente pasta before you put them in the pan. They won't cook that much in the pan

[^3]: Don't worry if it doesn't seem that saucy

[^4]: You don't want it saucy like pasta; the taste is too strong

[^5]: You want it all covered in sauce but a bit dry
