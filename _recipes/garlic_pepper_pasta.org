This recipe is the favorite of my dad.
After a long and hard day at work, this pasta dish is all he needs to be in peace and happy.
It is super-easy and straightforward but incredibly delicious.

2. The sauce takes minutes to prepare so bring the water to the boil.
Do not add a lot of salt to the water since the sauce is a little strong on seasoning.

3. *The reaction after adding the anchovies is pretty violent, so add them and with a wooden spoon and melt them with the heat off*

4. You can prepare a little fancy garnish by toasting some breadcrumbs and fresh parsley in a non-stick pan until breadcrumbs are golden brown.
Once you serve the pasta sprinkle some breadcrumbs on the pasta.
