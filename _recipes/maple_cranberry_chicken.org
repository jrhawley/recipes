* Directions

  1. Preheat your oven to 190 C (375 F).
  2. Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat and add the olive oil.
     - Season the chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper and add them to the hot pan to sear them on both sides until golden brown [fn:1].
     - Once the chicken is browned, remove them, place them on a plate and set aside.
  3. Add the white wine to the pan with the chicken juices and whisk as the wine begins to evaporate
     - Add the maple syrup, dijon mustard, and cranberries, and whisk to combine until a thin sauce forms
  4. Add the chicken back into the pan and spoon the sauce over the chicken
     - Sprinkle the cranberries into the pan over the chicken and add the sprigs of rosemary around the chicken
  5. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until cooked through
