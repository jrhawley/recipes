4. While the prawns are cooking, cook pasta to /al dente/
5. Drain pasta and toss together with prawns and zucchini

* References & Notes

1. Original recipe: Giacomo Grillo.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
We can say that this is a classic.
In Italy you may find a risotto cooked with the same ingredients, but a pasta dish is a perfect way to celebrate two ingredients made for one another.

2. Try to use "elongated shallots" (aka "banana shallots") because they're sweeter and less harsh on the palate.

3. Make sure that frozen prawns are completely defrosted / fresh prawns are clean (I [Giacomo] normally use raw peeled frozen prawns)
