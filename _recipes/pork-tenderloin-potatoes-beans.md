1. Mix salt, rosemary, black pepper, and minced garlic in a small bowl
	1. Rub pork all over with the olive oil and then coat it well with the spice mixture on all sides
2. Heat a pan to medium-high heat
	2. Sear all sides of the park tenderloin until brown, but don't cook through
	3. Place onion on the bottom of the slow cooker on one side, and then place the pork on top of the onion
	4. Gently drizzle the soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce over the pork
3. Use a large piece of foil to make a pocket for the potatoes next to the pork
	5. Make it large enough so the pork juice doesnâ€™t get into the foil
	6. Fill the foil with the cubed potatoes and add 1 Tbsp of butter
4. Cook for 4 h on LOW or until the pork registers 145 F
	7. Let the pork rest for 3 min
5. While the pork is resting, place the potatoes in a large bowl and add the remaining butter, chopped parsley and salt to taste
	8. Stir to combine
	9. Slice the pork and place it on a serving platter
