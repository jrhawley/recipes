   3. Wrap garlic tightly in the foil and place on a small baking pan.
   4. Bake on the middle rack until very soft, ~ 45 min.

4. Squeeze the garlic out of the husks and place in a food processor with butter, parsley, and salt.
   1. Parse the processor until smooth.
   2. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate for up to 3 days.
5. When preparing the bread, preheat the oven to 450 F.
