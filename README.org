This is my recipe book.
I have spent many years collecting and refining recipes, here.
I've collected them from friends, from family, and from strangers.
It's not much, but it tastes good.

* Usage

  Recipes, ingredients, and more are written in [[https://orgmode.org/][org-mode]].
  The HTML is generated with [[https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook][mdBook]].

  To compile the documents into a website, run

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mdbook build
  #+END_SRC

  This will compile everything into the [[file:docs/][=docs/=]] folder.
  Pushing the git repo will then update the website, which is hosted by GitHub Pages.

  To build and serve a live, local version of the online book, run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  mdbook serve
  #+END_SRC
