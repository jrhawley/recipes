   3. Cover mixture with water (leave small amount of space at the top of the slow cooker)
2. Cook on high for 4 h, or low for 6-8 h
   1. With 1 h left, use potato masher and mash fruits until they're soft
   2. Let mixture cook for remaining hour
3. Strain out apple cider juice into clean pitcher
   1. Press through fine-mesh or strain with cheese cloth to get the most out of it
